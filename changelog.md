# Change Log

### 1.0.6 2020-08-02

The CMake targets have changed to the following:

```cmake
    find_package(lp3-main)
    target_link_libraries(main lp3::main)
```

This is thanks to a new feature in Conan 1.28.0 which allows the exported CMake namespaces of multiple Conan projects to be shared.

### 1.0.5 2020-06-20

Only builds tests / drivers if BUILD_TESTING and LP3_MAIN_Build_Tests is set. This is to avoid building and running tests when creating recipes. It also keeps test dependencies out of the build requirements.

### 1.0.4 2020-06-19 find_package name changed

The CMake targets have changed to the following:

```cmake
    find_package(lp3-main)
    target_link_libraries(main lp3-main::lp3-main)
```

I **really** wanted to use `find_package(Lp3-Main)` with the target then being `lp3::main`, but even though Conan has [dramatically increased support for matching esoteric CMake target names](https://github.com/TimSimpson/lp3-sdl/issues/5) it still can't pull this off, and wants the first part of the target (ie the part before `::`) to be identical to the argument to `find_package` (so `find_package(Lp3-Main)` had to have targets like `Lp3-Main::main`). Nuts.

For the record, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to share the prefix amongst targets brought in by `find_package` even when using nothing but CMake. Anyway it's probably not worth caring about... though man it sure is ugly.

### 1.0.3 2020-06-11 bug fix

üêû Fixed a gross bug in PlatformLoop on Windows which triggered an assert error in debug mode (who knows what really happened in release) whenever it read the command line arguments (so, like, all the time üò¨). `wcstombs_s` is a harsh mistress.
